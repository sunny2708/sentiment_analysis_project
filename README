🐍 Environment Setup
This project requires Python 3.11. It's recommended to use Conda for managing dependencies.

🔧 Create a Conda Environment
bash
Copy
Edit
conda create -n ml_pipeline python=3.11
conda activate ml_pipeline
📦 Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirement.txt
✅ You can optionally create a conda environment YAML file for more portable sharing. Let me know if you want one.

🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2. Activate Conda Environment
bash
Copy
Edit
conda activate ml_pipeline
3. Train the Model
bash
Copy
Edit
python train.py
Model checkpoints will be saved in the models/ directory. Logs are stored in the logs/ folder.

🌐 Run the Web App
To start the application (if applicable):

bash
Copy
Edit
python app.py
⚙️ Configuration
Modify config.py to customize model parameters, dataset paths, logging behavior, etc.

✨ Utility Modules
text_preprocessing.py: Handles normalization, cleaning, and tokenization of input text.

data_generator.py: Efficient data loading for training batches.

logger.py: Custom logger setup.

utils.py: Additional utility functions used throughout the project.

✅ To Do
 Add conda environment YAML file

 Add pretrained models (if applicable)

 Add API documentation or Swagger UI for app.py
